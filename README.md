# **💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning**

## 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning classification algorithms to predict water quality based on chemical and physical parameters. By analyzing a cleaned dataset and training models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), the project aims to classify water samples as safe or unsafe for consumption.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean raw water quality data

- Perform feature engineering and visualization

- Train and evaluate multiple classification models

- Save and deploy the best-performing model (water_quality_svm_model.pkl)

- Provide reproducible workflows via Jupyter Notebook
